# HTML And Analog to Quosures

So far the explanation of quosures and how they can be used to change how R interprets
its syntax is a bit on the abstract side. A lot of R users are familar with 
html or at least know that javascript is used to make dynamic web pages.

html is a language, a markup language, and it has language
operational components just like R does. In fact using javascript to make a 
dynamic web page is the same as *programming on the language* in R.

However in html it's a lot easier to 
see the html's equivalent of an *Expression Object Model* in concrete terms.
So let's do that.

Here is a trival example of an HTML page. It's in `trivial.html` from the 
files you can download for this tutorial.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>A Tivial Example</title>
This is an example of a valid web page.
```

At first glance you might think that this is not a valid web page because it seems
to be missing many tags you probably think are required. For example the is no
`<html>` tag

If you open the `trivial.html` file in your web browser it will display properly.
However opening a file is not a test for html validity... no browsers check html for
validity and will display almost anything given to them.

However if you go to the W3C web page for checking the validity of html at
https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input and check this example there you will
find that the syntax, one of the operational components of html, of this page
is correct.

The syntax for html is defined on the W3C site at
https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/ . If you 
dig into it (please don't, it's pretty overwhelming :-)  you will find that many tags
are optional, for example the `<html>` tag https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-html-element

So where might you have gotten the idea that the `html` tag and friends are
required? It's probably becasue you more familar with the model component
of html than with it's syntax.

The W3C calls the model component of html the Document Object Model or DOM.
That's where
I got the idea of calling the model component of R expresions the
*Expression Object Model*. The W3C formally documents the DOM at
https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109/ . 

The DOM defines a number of objects that can be used to represent html in
memory, just as the `rlang` package does.

Here is an example of the tool that Chrome provides for exploring the DOM, the
equivalent of the *Expression Object Model* for R.

![Visualization of the DOM](htmlmodel.png)

Notice that the *missing* tags seem to have appeared! Actually what you see are
not tags, the are markers that represent objects used in the in memory model of
the html for the page. 

There are some utilitarian differences between the W3C DOM and the `rlang` 
*Expression Object Model*. The W3C formally defines the model component of html
and the `rlang`
package does not. Also out there in 
the wild that are a lot of tools for visually exploring the DOM. In R we don't
have comprehensive tools  to visually explore a quosure.

html, not the DOM, is designed to build a static web page. In classic html the
only way to "liven" up a page by making it change, 
except for some simpistic changes like a drop down menu,
is to request the web site that
originally served up the page to send a new page to the 
browser.

The way you make a dynamic web page, for example the way Shiny does, is to
add some javascript to the page. That javascript examines and manipulates the
DOM, not the html, for the page. When you use javascript like this you are
*programming on the langauge*, the hypertext markup language.

With a quosure you can "program on the language" with the R langauge. 
The usage details are different but "programming on the langauge" in R
is the same thing
as using javascript with html to make dynamic web pages my maipulating
the DOM.
